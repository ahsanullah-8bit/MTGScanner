// IT IS ADVISED TO INCLUDE THIS BEFORE ANY QT INCLUDES TO MINIMIZE DAMAGE.

// There is a function named emit in oneapi/tbb/profiling.h, which conflicts with the
// Qt's emit keyword. There are lots of solutions for that as described at
// https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/issues/547
#ifndef Q_MOC_RUN

    #else
